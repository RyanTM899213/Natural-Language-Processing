    README


To run the programs, we need to have python installed and cd'd into the directory 
which contains the data files corresponding to each program so that python can access 
these files. To run the programs in terminal:

for number 1: 
    type python tcomp1.py followed by the name of the master comparison text file
    and then the at least two other text files we want to compare to the master.
    
for number 2:
    type python tcomp2.py followed by the name of the comparison text file names.
    ie python tcomp2.py tc1.dat tc2.dat tc3.dat
    
for number 3:
    type in terminal python index1.py word1.txt text1.txt index1.txt.
    this writes all data to index1.txt for the user to view after running this code.
    all data is manipulated and stored in that text file instead of printing to the 
    screen.
    
Also included is the typescript file which shows the terminal output when i ran the
programs from terminal. check this to verify my code runs correctly, but im sure you'll
run the code yourself.
